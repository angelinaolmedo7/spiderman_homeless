# Spiderman: Homeless

Spiderman was just kicked out of the MCU. He has no connections, and has no money as he is jobless. He was trying to find a job at as a pizza delivery guy, but the problem was no one would hire him because he didn't have a car and everyone assumed that he would not be able to deliver pizza's fast enough. Life was hard after marvel.
